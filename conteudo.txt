Skiing & Snowboarding at Badger Pass
Yosemite's Badger Pass is one of California’s original ski resorts in the Sierra Nevada and still to this day it is a favorite vacation destination for winter lovers. It is perfect for families and skiers and snowboarders of all levels.
  	
Yosemite Bicycling
One of the best ways to see Yosemite's many magnificent sights is on a bicycle. You can bring your own bike or rent a bike. With more than 12 miles of paved bike trails on the valley floor, you can experience some of the most picturesque places in the park.
	
Yosemite Rock Climbing
Yosemite offers half-day or full day guided trips for climbers of all levels. Climbing lessons, all-women’s climbing and advanced climbs are all offered and available in Yosemite and at Fresno Dome.
	 	
Horseback Rides
Saddle Up! Horseback Rides in Yosemite National Park are exciting for everyone. There are a few stables in Yosemite including a ride through Mariposa Grove of the Giant Sequoias in Yosemite. The rides vary from 2 hours to all day and are a great way to see the sights of Yosemite.
	 	
Yosemite Fishing
Yosemite offers excellent fishing opportunities with hundreds of miles of river and lake shore access. Nearby Lake McClure, Lake McSwain, Lake Don Pedro and Bass Lake offer beautiful shorelines to catch native trout, bass and much more.
	 	
River Rafting

El Capitan
El Capitan is a vertical rock formation in Yosemite National Park, located on the north side of Yosemite Valley, near its western end. The granite monolith extends about 3,000 feet (900 m) from base to summit along its tallest face, and is one of the world's favorite challenges for rock climbers and BASE jumpers.

Half Dome
Half Dome is a granite dome in Yosemite National Park, located in northeastern Mariposa County, California, at the eastern end of Yosemite Valley — possibly Yosemite's most familiar rock formation. The granite crest rises more than 4,737 ft (1,444 m) above the valley floor.

Yosemite Falls
Yosemite Falls is the highest measured waterfall in North America. Located in Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada of California, it is a major attraction in the park, especially in late spring when the water flow is at its peak.
The total 2,425 feet (739 m) from the top of the upper fall to the base of the lower fall qualifies Yosemite Falls as the sixth highest waterfall in the world, though with the recent discovery of Gocta Cataracts, it appears on some lists as seventh.

Nevada Fall
Nevada Fall is a 594-foot (181 m) high waterfall on the Merced River in Yosemite National Park, California. It is located below the granite dome, Liberty Cap, at the west end of Little Yosemite Valley. The waterfall is widely recognized by its "bent" shape, in which the water free-falls for roughly the first third of its length to a steep slick-rock slope. This mid-fall impact of the water on the cliff face creates a turbulent, whitewater appearance in the falls and produces a great deal of mist which covers a wide radius, which led to its current name (Nevada is an old Spanish word meaning "snowy"). Additionally, when viewed from the left-hand side, its angular shape is suggestive of the western border of the state of Nevada.
